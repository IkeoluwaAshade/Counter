### `How the Counter Works`
There is really nothing spectacular about the counter app. There are 2 buttons (the increase `+` and the decrease `-`) and a display box where you tend to see your increasing and decreasing values


### `In-view`
I intend adding a nav-bar that displays the `Home`, `About App` (Just a short descretion of the app), and `Author` (About me).

### `Resources`

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com).
